------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  What's new in each version of Interchange
                       (since the version 5.10 branch)

          See UPGRADE document for a list of incompatible changes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Interchange 5.10.1 released ?


Admin UI
--------

* Respect custom BACKUP_DIRECTORY in admin table downloads. This matches
  behavior expected by [export-database].

* Allow admin user to export tables upon request despite NoExportExternal.
  NoExportExternal was intended to ensure automatic products/ exports don't
  happen, but we shouldn't stop manual exports to the download directory.

* Expand table editor / imagehelper features for file uploads.

* Update Perl module checks in Administration > Info > Perl Information tab.


Usertags, filters
-----------------

* In [image] search for upper and lower case of file suffixes, in predictable
  order.

* In [deliver], extra headers should always be sent, even for a redirect. (Our
  redirects were always cacheable unless explicitly set prior to deliver call.)

* Add date-change filter "common" boolean option to output date+time without T
  separator, e.g. 2016-03-31 12:34:56 instead of 2016-03-31T12:34:56.

* Add support for [all-anchor] token in [more-list] template


Database interaction
--------------------

* Changed dbconf files for userdb, transactions, and orderline to reflect a
  varchar(255) definition for username, usernick, and email. Previously were a
  mis-matched variations of lengths, that do not provide adequate length for
  modern email addresses.

* Fix error creating indexes when QUOTE_IDENTIFIERS is set.


Core
----

* Work around unit test problem caused by UTF-8.

* Fix memory leak where new session would retain previous version of
  $::Control.

* In &Vend::Order:add_items:

** Fix long-wrong code which had the effect of always stripping - signs.

** Fix code which was intended to remove amounts after the decimal point unless
   FractionalItems.

* Properly-backquote \X in ESCAPE_CHARS. This resolves "warning: unrecognized
  escape \X".

* Fix for BounceReferrals including process path.

* Avoid warning when &Vend::Data::item_price is called with a SKU rather than hashref.

* Fix DBI quoting problem in &Vend::Table::DBI::delete_record that appears with newer
  versions of DBD::Pg.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Interchange 5.10.0 released January 5, 2016

Admin UI
--------

* Admin passwords encrypted with Bcrypt by default.

* test_code page removed (deemed slight security risk). Copy in eg/ if needed.


Payment Modules
---------------

* Removed defunct GoogleCheckout module.

* Removed defunct Signio module; use PayFlowPro instead.

* Add support for Merchantware payment gateway.


Strap Demo
----------

* New default demo catalog, based on Bootstrap Framework. See dist/strap/README for details.
* User passwords encrypted with Bcrypt by default.


Standard Demo
-------------

* The standard demo has been relegated to the annals of time. It can be obtained from previous Interchange versions.


External tool support
---------------------

* Add secure JSON query generation for interface with AJAX widgets. Allows generation of
  queries vetted by login, with either public access or access gated by session.


Core
----

* [bounce] tags abort further ITL processing.

* Support additional test credit card numbers.

* Add "set_source" SpecialSub for affiliate change hooks.

* Allow the quoting of identifiers in Database directives to better support
  columns with keywords as names.

* New DebugTemplate tokens for more informative logging.

* Support direct JSON POSTs and automatic decoding of POSTed JSON entities in the $CGI::json_ref using the new UnpackJSON directive.
